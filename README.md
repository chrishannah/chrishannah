👋 Hi, I'm Chris Hannah.

💻 I spend a lot of my time building software. Whether that's at my day job as an *~Enterprise Solutions Engineer~* Software Engineer, working on my personal projects such as the [open-source stuff on GitHub](https://github.com/chrishannah), my iOS/macOS text transformation app, [Text Case](https://textcase.app/), or any other small bits of code I write.

📚 I'm not in a position where I currently have a *go-to* programming language or toolset for programming. I've used Swift a lot for apps, I use Java a lot at my day job, and I'm always tinkering with web technology. 

🌱 One thing I'm thinking about learning is Rust. Although I'm not sure if I'll ever have a suitable use case for it.

📝 When I'm not writing code, I'm usually writing [on my blog](https://chrishannah.me). It tends to be focussed on technology, but is now becoming more personal.

📫 If you want to reach me, I'd suggest either <a rel="me" href="https://bulbasaur.garden/@chris">Mastodon</a> or [Email](mailto:me@chrishannah.me).
