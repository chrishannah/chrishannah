I am a:
- Senior Software Engineer at Ant Group/WorldFirst working on all sorts of REST APIs, ERP integrations, internal tools, and a load more. (Mostly Java, but also recently Python and JavaScript).
- iOS/macOS developer. My current apps are [Text Shot](https://chrishannah.me/text-shot/) and [Text Case](https://textcase.app/).
- contributer to free, open-source software. My most recent project is to take the core text transformation tools of my Text Case app and make them available in the command line - [Text Case CLI](https://github.com/chrishannah/textcase-cli).
- Writer/blogger at [chrishannah.me](https://chrishannah.me).
- Learning Rust with [pst](https://github.com/chrishannah/pst).

I'm also currently open for new roles. If you're interested, [check out my online cv](https://chrishannah/cv).
